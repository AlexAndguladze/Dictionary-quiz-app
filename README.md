This is my first android project with xamarin forms. Used MVVM design pattern (credit to James montemagno tutorials on YT)
In this app you can save word definitions on English or Georgian and integrated quiz will help you remember those words(I wanted to make users create their own word collections but my knowledge was limited)

The idea came while I was reading books and writing unknown words in notepad app which wasn't really useful because I was too lazy to read it later.
So I decided to make an app which would help me learn new words more easily.

THIS IS PERSONAL PROJECT FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES
